The DaemonSet object is designed to ensure that a single pod runs on each worker node. This means you cannot scale daemonset pods in a node. And for some reason, if the daemonset pod gets deleted from the node, the daemonset controller creates it again.

Letâ€™s look at an example. If there are 500 worker nodes and you deploy a daemonset, the daemonset controller will run one pod per worker node by default. That is a total of 500 pods. However, using nodeSelector, nodeAffinity, Taints, and Tolerations, you can restrict the daemonset to run on specific nodes.
